# GitHub Actions Fix - Updated Deprecated Actions

## Issue
GitHub Actions workflow was failing due to deprecated action versions:
```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`.

```

## Solution
Updated all GitHub Actions to their latest versions in `/workspace/.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `actions/checkout`
```yaml
# Before
- uses: actions/checkout@v3

# After
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### 2. Updated `actions/setup-node`
```yaml
# Before
- uses: actions/setup-node@v3

# After
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
```

### 3. Updated `actions/upload-artifact` (Critical Fix)
```yaml
# Before
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3

# After
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

### 4. Updated `actions/github-script`
```yaml
# Before
- uses: actions/github-script@v6

# After
- uses: actions/github-script@v7
```

## File Updated
- `/workspace/.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`

## Impact
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow will no longer fail due to deprecated actions
- ✅ Using latest stable versions with improved performance and features
- ✅ Future-proofed against upcoming deprecations

## Breaking Changes
None expected. All updates are backward compatible.

## Testing
The workflow will be tested on the next:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branch
- Pull request to `main` or `develop` branch
- Manual workflow trigger

## Permissions Fix

Added permissions block to allow PR comments:

```yaml
jobs:
  integration-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
```

Also added error handling to prevent workflow failure if comment posting fails:

```yaml
- name: Comment test results on PR
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  continue-on-error: true  # Don't fail workflow if comment fails
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      try {
        await github.rest.issues.createComment({...});
      } catch (error) {
        console.log('Could not post comment:', error.message);
      }
```

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Ready to commit and push
