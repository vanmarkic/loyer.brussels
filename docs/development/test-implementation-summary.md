# Test Implementation Summary: Apartment Size Acceleration Feature

## Date: 2024
## Task: Write failing tests for accelerating hold-repeat functionality

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of failing tests for the apartment size adjustment acceleration feature. The tests are designed to fail with the current implementation, which uses a fixed 150ms interval, to highlight the need for acceleration functionality.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Unit Tests (Vitest)

**File**: `app/components/rental-calculator/__tests__/property-details-step.hold-repeat.spec.tsx`

Two new test cases were added:

#### Test 1: Increment Acceleration
```typescript
it("should accelerate increment speed when holding plus button for longer", () => {
  // Holds + button for 1600ms total
  // Expected: > 15 increments (with acceleration)
  // Actual: 12 increments (fixed interval)
  // Status: ✅ FAILING AS EXPECTED
})
```

**Result**: 
- ❌ **FAILING** (as intended)
- Expected: `> 15` increments
- Actual: `12` increments
- Error: `expected 12 to be greater than 15`

#### Test 2: Decrement Acceleration
```typescript
it("should accelerate decrement speed when holding minus button for longer", () => {
  // Holds - button for 1600ms total
  // Expected: > 15 decrements (with acceleration)
  // Actual: 11 decrements (fixed interval)
  // Status: ✅ FAILING AS EXPECTED
})
```

**Result**:
- ❌ **FAILING** (as intended)
- Expected: `> 15` decrements
- Actual: `11` decrements
- Error: `expected 11 to be greater than 15`

### 2. E2E Tests (Playwright)

**File**: `tests/e2e/property-size-hold-repeat.spec.ts`

Two new E2E test cases were added:

#### Test 1: E2E Increment Acceleration
```typescript
test("should accelerate increment speed when + button is held for longer", async ({ page }) => {
  // Holds + button for 2000ms
  // Expected: > 20 increments (with acceleration)
  // Status: Test added, will fail with current implementation
})
```

#### Test 2: E2E Decrement Acceleration
```typescript
test("should accelerate decrement speed when - button is held for longer", async ({ page }) => {
  // Holds - button for 2000ms
  // Expected: > 20 decrements (with acceleration)
  // Status: Test added, will fail with current implementation
})
```

**Note**: E2E tests require playwright browsers to be installed to run.

### 3. Documentation

**File**: `docs/development/apartment-size-acceleration-spec.md`

Comprehensive specification document including:
- Current implementation analysis
- Required feature description
- Three-phase acceleration model:
  - Phase 1 (0-500ms): 150ms interval
  - Phase 2 (500-1500ms): 100ms interval
  - Phase 3 (1500ms+): 50ms interval
- Implementation guidelines
- Test specifications
- User story and acceptance criteria

## Test Execution Results

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- app/components/rental-calculator/__tests__/property-details-step.hold-repeat.spec.tsx --run
```

**Results**:
- Total tests: 12
- Passing: 10 ✅
- Failing: 2 ❌ (the new acceleration tests)
- Status: **Expected failures confirmed**

### E2E Tests
E2E tests were added but require playwright browser installation to execute. The test structure mirrors the unit tests and will fail for the same reasons.

## Why the Tests Fail

The current implementation in `app/hooks/use-hold-repeat.ts` uses a **fixed interval**:

```typescript
export function useHoldRepeat({
  onRepeat,
  interval = 150,  // Fixed at 150ms
  immediate = true,
}: UseHoldRepeatOptions): UseHoldRepeatReturn {
  // ...
  intervalRef.current = setInterval(onRepeat, interval);  // Never changes
  // ...
}
```

### Current Behavior:
- Fixed 150ms interval throughout the hold
- In 1600ms: ~10.67 cycles = 11-12 increments (with immediate call)
- In 2000ms: ~13.33 cycles = 14-15 increments (with immediate call)

### Expected Behavior (with acceleration):
- Phase 1 (0-500ms at 150ms): ~3-4 increments
- Phase 2 (500-1500ms at 100ms): ~10 increments
- Phase 3 (1500ms+ at 50ms): ~10 increments in next 500ms
- **Total in 2000ms: ~23-24 increments**

## Verification

The tests correctly fail with clear error messages:

```
✗ should accelerate increment speed when holding plus button for longer
  AssertionError: expected 12 to be greater than 15

✗ should accelerate decrement speed when holding minus button for longer
  AssertionError: expected 11 to be greater than 15
```

This confirms:
1. ✅ Tests are correctly written
2. ✅ Tests properly detect the absence of acceleration
3. ✅ Error messages are clear and informative
4. ✅ All existing tests still pass (no regression)

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

To make these tests pass, the following implementation is needed:

1. **Enhance `useHoldRepeat` hook** to support acceleration:
   - Add acceleration configuration options
   - Implement dynamic interval adjustment based on hold duration
   - Support multiple acceleration stages

2. **Update `PropertyDetailsStep` component**:
   - Enable acceleration for the increment/decrement controls
   - Configure appropriate acceleration stages

3. **Verify all tests pass**:
   - Unit tests should pass with acceleration
   - E2E tests should pass with acceleration
   - Existing tests should continue to pass (no regression)

## Files Modified

1. `app/components/rental-calculator/__tests__/property-details-step.hold-repeat.spec.tsx`
   - Added 2 failing test cases (+98 lines)

2. `tests/e2e/property-size-hold-repeat.spec.ts`
   - Added 2 E2E test cases (+96 lines)

3. `docs/development/apartment-size-acceleration-spec.md`
   - Created comprehensive specification (new file)

4. `docs/development/test-implementation-summary.md`
   - Created this summary document (new file)

## Conclusion

✅ **Task Completed Successfully**

The failing tests have been successfully implemented and verified. They clearly demonstrate the expected acceleration behavior and will guide the implementation of the acceleration feature. The tests fail with meaningful error messages that show exactly what behavior is expected vs. what is currently implemented.

The implementation is ready for the next phase: enhancing the `useHoldRepeat` hook to support acceleration and making these tests pass.
