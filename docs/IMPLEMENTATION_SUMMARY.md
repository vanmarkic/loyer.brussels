# Implementation Summary: Email & Database Features

## What Was Implemented

This implementation adds **email sending** and **database storage** functionality to the Loyer.Brussels application.

## 📦 Packages Installed

- **resend** (v6.1.1) - Modern email sending service for Next.js

## 🗄️ Database Tables Created

Two new Supabase tables:

### 1. `contact_submissions`

Stores contact form submissions with user details, messages, and preferences.

### 2. `questionnaire_responses`

Stores complete questionnaire data including property info, rental details, household info, and calculation results.

See `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` for complete SQL schema and setup instructions.

## 📧 Email Features

### Three Email Types Implemented:

1. **Contact Form - Admin Notification**

   - Sent to: Admin email (configured in ENV)
   - Contains: User's message and contact details
   - Template: HTML formatted with brand styling

2. **Contact Form - User Confirmation**

   - Sent to: User's email
   - Contains: Confirmation of receipt and next steps
   - Template: HTML formatted, friendly tone

3. **Questionnaire Confirmation**
   - Sent to: User's email after completing questionnaire
   - Contains: Submission ID, timestamp, and next steps
   - Template: HTML formatted with action items

All emails are in `app/lib/email.ts` with professional HTML templates.

### Modified Files:

```

└── [locale]/
    ├── contact/page.tsx                   # Added email/DB integration
    └── calculateur/bruxelles/questionnaire/page.tsx  # Added DB storage
package.json                                # Added resend dependency
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Contact Form Flow:

1. User fills out contact form
2. Client validates input
3. `submitContactForm()` server action is called
4. Data is saved to `contact_submissions` table
5. Admin notification email is sent
6. User confirmation email is sent
7. Success toast is shown, form is reset

### Questionnaire Flow:

1. User completes all questionnaire sections
2. On final step, `saveQuestionnaireResponse()` is called
3. Complete form state is saved to `questionnaire_responses` table
4. Confirmation email is sent to user
5. Success toast is shown
6. User is redirected to contact page

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ Server-side only database operations (server actions)
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on both tables
- ✅ Service role authentication for database access
- ✅ Input validation (email format, required fields)
- ✅ API keys kept server-side only
- ✅ SQL injection protection via Supabase
- ✅ XSS protection via React

## 📝 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables (.env.local):

```bash
# Supabase (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key

# NEW: Resend API
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# NEW: Email Configuration
EMAIL_FROM=contact@wuune.be
EMAIL_TO=contact@wuune.be
```

### Database Setup:

Run the SQL scripts in `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` to:

1. Create tables
2. Add indexes
3. Enable RLS
4. Create security policies

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set up Resend account and verify domain
- [ ] Create Supabase tables using provided SQL
- [ ] Add all environment variables
- [ ] Test contact form submission
- [ ] Verify emails are received (admin + user)
- [ ] Test questionnaire submission
- [ ] Check database records are created
- [ ] Verify error handling works
- [ ] Test on staging environment

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Resend Setup**:

   - Sign up at https://resend.com
   - Verify your domain (or use test domain)
   - Get API key
   - Add to environment variables

2. **Supabase Setup**:

   - Open SQL Editor in Supabase dashboard
   - Run all SQL from `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
   - Verify tables are created
   - Check RLS is enabled

3. **Environment Variables**:

   - Add all variables to production environment
   - Verify EMAIL_FROM uses verified Resend domain

4. **Deploy**:
   - Push code to production
   - Test contact form
   - Test questionnaire
   - Monitor Resend dashboard for email delivery
   - Monitor Supabase for database inserts

## 📊 Monitoring

### Email Delivery (Resend Dashboard):

- Delivery status
- Bounce rates
- Failed deliveries
- Email logs

### Database (Supabase Dashboard):

- View submissions in Table Editor
- Check API logs for errors
- Monitor database usage
