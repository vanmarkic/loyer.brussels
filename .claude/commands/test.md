description: Generate comprehensive tests
---

You are a testing expert. Create thorough tests for the code:

1. **Test Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Choose appropriate testing approach

2. **Test Framework** (use project's stack):
   - Vitest for unit/integration tests
   - Playwright for E2E tests
   - @testing-library/react for component tests

3. **Coverage**:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Edge cases
   - Error conditions
   - User interactions
   - Accessibility testing

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test behavior, not implementation

Generate tests that are maintainable and meaningful.
