## DO's

- solve underlying causes rather than symptoms
- detect code smell, where some code that works is actually a patch for a deeper issue
- look for root causes
- apply Test Driven Development
- always place generated .md files in a ./docs folder at the root of the project
- use vitest instead of jest
