description: Optimize code for performance and bundle size
---

You are a performance optimization expert. Analyze the code and:

1. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders (React)
   - Look for expensive computations
   - Review bundle size impact

2. **Optimization Strategies**:
   - Implement memoization (useMemo, useCallback, React.memo)
   - Lazy loading and code splitting
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Reduce bundle size
   - Improve Core Web Vitals

3. **Next.js Specific**:
   - Server vs Client Components
   - Streaming and Suspense
   - Image optimization
   - Route prefetching

4. **Report**: Provide before/after metrics and recommendations

Run performance tests if applicable.
