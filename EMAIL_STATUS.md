# Email Functionality Status

## Current State

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Email Code Implementation** - All email templates and sending logic are implemented
2. **Integration Tests** - Database operations and application logic fully tested (emails mocked)
3. **Graceful Degradation** - App continues working even if emails fail
4. **Test Infrastructure** - Tools ready to verify email functionality

## Test Results

### Integration Tests (Mocked) ✅

```bash
yarn test:integration
```

**Status:** ✅ **ALL PASSING** (20/20 tests)

- Questionnaire submission: 10/10 ✅
- Contact form submission: 10/10 ✅
- Database operations: Fully verified ✅
- Email calls: Mocked (parameters verified) ✅

### Email Script Test ❌

```bash
yarn test:email
```

**Status:** ❌ **FAILS** - Missing RESEND_API_KEY

```
Error: Missing API key. Pass it to the constructor `new Resend("re_123")`
```

This is **expected** - confirms Resend is not yet configured for this project.

## How to Verify Emails Are Working

To actually test email sending, you need to:

### Option 1: Use Resend Test Mode (Quickest)

1. Sign up for free account at https://resend.com
2. Get API key from https://resend.com/api-keys
3. Create `.env.local` file (copy from `env.example`):
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
   EMAIL_TO=contact@wuune.be
   ```
4. Run test script:
   ```bash
   yarn test:email
   ```

**Note:** With `onboarding@resend.dev`, emails can only be sent to the email address associated with your Resend account.

### Option 2: Verify Custom Domain (Production)

1. Complete Option 1 first
2. Add domain on https://resend.com/domains
3. Add DNS records for `loyer.brussels` or `wuune.be`:
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: @ (or subdomain)
   Value: [provided by Resend]
   ```
4. Wait for verification (< 24 hours)
5. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   EMAIL_FROM=contact@loyer.brussels
   EMAIL_TO=admin@loyer.brussels
   ```
6. Test again:
   ```bash
   yarn test:email
   ```

### Option 3: Skip Email Verification (Development Only)

If you don't need to test actual email sending:

- ✅ Integration tests already verify the app logic works
- ✅ Database operations are fully tested
- ✅ Email functions are called with correct parameters
- ✅ App handles email failures gracefully

The only thing NOT tested is actual email delivery, which is fine for development.

## What Integration Tests Actually Verify

Even with mocked emails, integration tests verify:

### ✅ Database Operations (Real Supabase)

```typescript
// 1. Submit questionnaire
const result = await saveQuestionnaireResponse(formState);

// 2. Query database directly to verify record exists
const { data: submission } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from("questionnaire_responses")
  .select("*")
  .eq("id", result.submissionId)
  .single();

// 3. Verify ALL fields were stored correctly
expect(submission?.email).toBe(testEmail);
expect(submission?.postal_code).toBe(1000);
expect(submission?.actual_rent).toBe(950);
// ... 40+ more assertions ...
```

### ✅ Email Function Calls (Mocked but Verified)

```typescript
// Verify email function was called with correct data
expect(sendQuestionnaireConfirmation).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
  email: testEmail,
  submissionId: result.submissionId,
  submissionDate: expect.any(String),
});
```

### ✅ Error Handling

```typescript
// Test that app continues working even if email fails
const result = await saveQuestionnaireResponse(formState);
expect(result.success).toBe(true); // Submission succeeds even if email fails
```

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production with email functionality:

- [ ] Sign up for Resend account
- [ ] Get API key and add to production environment variables
- [ ] Verify domain (`loyer.brussels` or `wuune.be`)
- [ ] Update `EMAIL_FROM` to use verified domain
- [ ] Set `EMAIL_TO` to correct admin email
- [ ] Run `yarn test:email` to verify emails send successfully
- [ ] Check Resend dashboard for delivery stats
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerts for email failures

## Current Recommendation

### For Development

**No action needed!**

- Integration tests are working perfectly
- App functionality is fully verified
- Database operations are tested end-to-end
- Email logic is validated (parameters, error handling)

### For Production

**Configure Resend when ready to launch:**

1. Follow "Option 1" above to test email sending
2. Follow "Option 2" to configure production domain
3. Run `yarn test:email` to verify before deployment

## Files Created

1. **`scripts/test-email.ts`** - Manual test script to send real emails
2. **`app/lib/__tests__/email.e2e.test.ts`** - E2E tests for email (skipped by default)
3. **`EMAIL_TESTING.md`** - Complete guide for testing emails
4. **`env.example`** - Example environment configuration
5. **This file** - Current status and recommendations

## Next Steps

**Option A: Test Emails Now**

```bash
# 1. Get Resend API key
# 2. Create .env.local (see env.example)
# 3. Run test
yarn test:email
```

**Option B: Continue Development**

```bash
# Integration tests work fine without Resend configured
yarn test:integration  # ✅ All tests passing
```

**Option C: Deploy Without Email**

```bash
# App works fine, just won't send emails
# Users won't get confirmations
# You won't get contact notifications
```

Choose based on your current priorities!
