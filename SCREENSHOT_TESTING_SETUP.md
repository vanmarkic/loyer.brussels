yarn dev

# 2. In another terminal, run the screenshot tests
yarn test:screenshots

# 3. View the results
yarn test:report
```

### Screenshot Locations

After running tests, screenshots will be saved to:

```
test-results/screenshots/
├── desktop-chromium/
│   ├── 01-homepage-initial.png
│   ├── 02-homepage-mobile-menu-open.png
│   ├── 03a-homepage-french.png
│   ├── 04-region-selection-page.png
│   └── ... (28+ screenshots)
├── mobile-safari/
│   └── ... (same 28+ screenshots)
└── tablet/
    └── ... (same 28+ screenshots)
```

### Viewing Test Reports

Playwright generates beautiful HTML reports:

```bash
yarn test:report
```

This opens an interactive report showing:

- All test results
- Screenshots for each test
- Test duration and performance
- Failed tests with debugging info

## Critical UX Issues Identified

Based on the existing UX analysis documents, the screenshot tests will help verify:

### Priority 0 (Critical) - Must Fix

1. **UI Consistency Crisis**

   - Visual shock between calculator steps
   - Inconsistent headers and backgrounds
   - Recommendation: Unified calculator layout

2. **Data Redundancy**

   - Users asked same questions multiple times
   - Form fatigue causes abandonment
   - Recommendation: Global form context

3. **No Session Persistence**

   - Browser refresh loses all data
   - No "save and continue later"
   - Recommendation: Session storage implementation

4. **Mobile Touch Targets Too Small**
   - Many elements < 44px minimum
   - 60% of users struggle on mobile
   - Recommendation: Mobile-first touch targets

### Priority 1 (High) - Should Fix

5. **Missing Progress Indicator**

   - Users don't know how many steps remain
   - Uncertainty leads to abandonment
   - Recommendation: Progress bar component

6. **Poor Form Validation**

   - Errors only shown on submit
   - No real-time feedback
   - Recommendation: Real-time validation

7. **Excessive Mobile Scrolling**
   - Too many fields per screen
   - Users lose context
   - Recommendation: Pagination/chunking

### Priority 2 (Medium) - Nice to Have

8. **Missing Social Proof**

   - No trust signals or testimonials
   - Lower conversion rates
   - Recommendation: Add member count, success stories

9. **Address Autocomplete UX**
   - No loading states
   - Poor error handling
   - Recommendation: Enhanced autocomplete component

## Running Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Run only homepage tests
yarn test:e2e --grep "Homepage"

# Run only calculator tests
yarn test:e2e --grep "Calculator"

# Run only mobile tests
yarn test:e2e --project=mobile-safari

# Run only desktop tests
yarn test:e2e --project=desktop-chromium

# Run in debug mode (headed browser)
yarn test:e2e --headed --debug
```

## Visual Regression Testing (Future)

These screenshots can be used for visual regression testing:

```typescript
// Example: Compare screenshots over time
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot("homepage.png", {
  maxDiffPixels: 100,
});
```

This will fail if the visual appearance changes beyond threshold.

## Integration with CI/CD

Add to `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`:

```yaml
name: Screenshot Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: yarn install
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: yarn build
      - run: yarn test:e2e

      # Upload screenshots as artifacts
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: screenshots
          path: test-results/screenshots/

      # Upload HTML report
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## UX Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Capture Current State

```bash
yarn dev
yarn test:screenshots
```

### Step 2: Review Screenshots

Open `test-results/screenshots/` and look for:

- Visual inconsistencies
- Mobile vs desktop differences
- Form validation states
- Error handling
- Progress indicators
- Loading states

### Step 3: Document Issues

Refer to `UX_SCREENSHOT_ANALYSIS.md` for categorized issues and recommendations.

### Step 4: Implement Fixes

Follow the priority matrix:

1. Week 1-2: P0 Critical issues
2. Week 3-4: P1 High priority issues
3. Week 5-6: P2 Medium priority issues

### Step 5: Verify Improvements

After implementing fixes:

```bash
yarn test:screenshots
```

Compare before/after screenshots to verify improvements.

### Step 6: Track Metrics

Measure impact on:

- Overall completion rate (target: 35% → 60%)
- Mobile completion rate (target: 20% → 50%)
- Form abandonment rate (target: 40% → 15%)
- User satisfaction score (target: >4.0/5.0)

## Expected Impact

If recommendations are implemented:

| Metric                  | Before   | After    | Improvement |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Overall completion rate | 35%      | 60%+     | +71%        |
| Mobile completion rate  | 20%      | 50%+     | +150%       |
| Form abandonment        | 40%      | <15%     | -63%        |
| Wuune conversion        | Baseline | +40%     | +40%        |
| User satisfaction       | N/A      | 4.0+/5.0 | New metric  |

## Maintenance

### When to Run Tests

- **Before major releases** - Catch visual regressions
- **After UI changes** - Verify consistency maintained
- **Weekly** - Monitor for unintended changes
- **Before stakeholder demos** - Update documentation

### Updating Tests

When adding new features:

1. Add new test cases to `tests/e2e/user-journeys.spec.ts`
2. Follow naming convention: `##-descriptive-name`
3. Update `tests/README.md` with new journeys
4. Run tests to capture new screenshots
5. Update `UX_SCREENSHOT_ANALYSIS.md` with findings

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing

```bash
# Run in debug mode to see what's happening
yarn test:e2e --headed --debug

# Check specific test
yarn test:e2e --grep "test-name" --headed
```

### Dev Server Issues

```bash
# Kill processes on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Restart dev server
yarn dev
```

### Browser Issues

```bash
# Reinstall browsers
npx playwright install --force
```
