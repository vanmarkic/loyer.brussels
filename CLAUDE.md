- apply Test Driven Development
- write test before adding a feature
- write tests BEFORE changing a feature or solving a bug (red-green-refactor)
- write failing test first to reproduce the bug, then fix it
- write tests for new features before implementing them
- solve underlying causes rather than symptoms
- detect code smell, which is when some code that works is actually a patch for a deeper issue
- look for root causes of problems
- use vitest instead of jest
- leave the codebase cleaner than you found it (boyscout rule)
- use mcp servers
- make a web search by default then use mcp servers accordingly
- removing code is a very good thing
