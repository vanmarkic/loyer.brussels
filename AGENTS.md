## DO's

- solve underlying causes rather than symptoms
- detect code smell, where some code that works is actually a patch for a deeper issue
- look for root causes
- apply Test Driven Development
- always place generated \*.md files in a ./docs folder at the root of the project
- always check if an existing \*.md file can be modified instead of creating a new one for keeping track of your progress
- use vitest instead of jest
- leave the codebase cleaner than you found it (boyscout rule)
- use context7 mcp server
